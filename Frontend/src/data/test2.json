        "commentary": "<p>During a car ride, designer Cole and his wife were listening to an audio book of T. H. White's <strong>The Once and Future King</strong>. When the Monarch of Moat delivered the following line to Arthur, it spawned a series of ideas creating the framework for Root, a game of Might and Right: &quot;...There is only power. Power is of the individual mind, but the mind's power is not enough. Power of the body decides everything in the end, and only Might is Right.&quot;</p>",
        "faq": "<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Who goes first?</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to the official rules, your group determines the starting player and seating order randomly (Rule 5.1.1). After the starting player finishes their turn, the next clockwise player begins their turn (Rule 1.5). A common house (unofficial) rule among fans is to have the Marquise (Cat) faction start the game especially at 4 or more player counts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is this a good 2-player game?</strong></p>\r\n<p>While some may still enjoy the 2-player gameplay (and I am one of them), it's not the ideal player count due to limited number of viable faction combinations. Every faction has an assigned \"Reach Value\" that represents the amount of influence they can have over the board state, and Leder Games recommends that the total Reach Value should equal or exceed the minimum indicated for the player count (see table below). For example, for 2-player gameplay using the base game, the only viable factions are Marquise and Eyrie.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"w-50\" src=\"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/700x700/games/userfiles/1613783703105-root%20faction%20reach%20values.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>If you want to have a fuller experience at a 2-player count, here are some options:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Get <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/AMEwdJGV5c/root-the-clockwork-expansion\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: 'AMEwdJGV5c', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Root: The Clockwork Expansion</a> - Adds simulated opponent(s).

Other than each player's individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &quot;Encounter&quot; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.<br /><br /><em>Scythe</em> uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.<br /><br />Every part of <em>Scythe</em> has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.</p>",

        "description_preview": "  Scythe  gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player's individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are \"Encounter\" cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.   Scythe  uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.  Every part of  Scythe  has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times. "

        "description": "<p><em><strong>Wingspan</strong></em> is a competitive, medium-weight, card-driven, engine-building board game from Stonemaier Games.</p>\r\n<p>You are bird enthusiasts—researchers, bird watchers, ornithologists, and collectors—seeking to discover and attract the best birds to your aviary. Each bird extends a chain of powerful combinations in one of your habitats (actions). These habitats focus on several key aspects of growth:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Gain food tokens via custom dice in a birdfeeder dice tower</li>\r\n<li>Lay eggs using egg miniatures in a variety of colors</li>\r\n<li>Draw from hundreds of unique bird cards and play them</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The winner is the player with the most points after 4 rounds.</p>",
        "commentary": "<ul>\r\n<li>Wingspan's artists, Ana and Natalia, have been friends since high school in Colombia. After Natalia moved to the U.S., she ran into <a href=\"/designer/MANNUPclkd/alan-stone\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Stone</a> through their kids' school, which led to her getting connected with <a href=\"/designer/QIz5pAPzFk/jamey-stegmaier\" target=\"_blank\">Jamey Stegmaier</a> of <a href=\"/publisher/njVFVNfJc7/stonemaier-games\" target=\"_blank\">Stonemaier Games</a>. Check out this interview <a href=\"/forum/XTO9WbDBqe/how-the-best-board-game-of-2019-wingspan-reunited-two-high-school-friends-interview\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></li>\r\n<li>In an interview, designer <a href=\"/designer/UBhK4cSEV6/elizabeth-hargrave\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Hargrave</a> commented that she felt &quot;... there were too many games about castles and space, and not enough games about things I'm interested in. So I decided to make a game about something I cared about.&quot;</li>\r\n</ul>",
        "faq": "<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Is it hard to learn?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The rulebook is well-organized and easy to follow. You can learn how to play the game after reading through 10 pages of rules accompanied by plenty of visual cues and breathing space between text. Alternatively, you can use the Quick-Reference Guide (page 2 of the Appendix) if you want to learn the game in real-time.</p>\r\n<p>Veteran gamers will find it relatively easy to learn and teach, while new gamers may feel that it's more complex than what they're used to. When it comes to learning the actual strategy, the game will likely \"click\" for the majority of the players by the time your group finishes the 1st Round (there are 4 Rounds total).</p>\r\n<p>Due to the game's simple turn structure and types of actions available, you'll quickly pick up on how the game works by watching your friends play. So while you may not be playing optimally or finding the best combos to pull off, you'll likely feel comfortable by the start of Round 2.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For those who've played Stonemaier Games' <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/7NYbgH2Z2I/viticulture-essential-edition\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: '7NYbgH2Z2I', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Viticulture: Essential Edition</a>, Wingspan is less complex than Viticulture in terms of strategy elements and has fewer rules to memorize. If you have detailed questions about the game, you'll likely find an answer within this <a href=\"https://stonemaiergames.com/games/wingspan/rules/\">comprehensive FAQ</a> put together by Stonemaier Games.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is it good for 2 players?</strong></p>\r\n<p>2-player gameplay won't trigger pink bird powers as frequently, which are activated once per turn if a criteria is met during an opponent's turn (e.g. get \"X\" benefit when another player does \"Y\" action). There will also be less competition for valuable birds cards or for the food dice from the birdfeeder.</p>\r\n<p>Wingspan is a relatively low interaction game. This means that the gameplay won't feel much different at low or high player counts and makes for an easily scalable game. So if you love Wingspan at high player counts, you'll love it at 2-player count as well. On the other hand, if you're someone who prefers highly interactive games where your actions directly impact another player's strategies, you should try it out before making the purchase.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is there a hand limit?</strong></p>\r\n<p>There is no limit to the number of bird cards you can have in your hand.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can you play alone?</strong></p>\r\n<p>As with most Stonemaier Games titles, Wingspan comes with a separate set of rules for the Automa, an AI opponent that simulates playing against a human opponent. This game was rated #13 on \"2020 People's Choice Top 200 Solo Games.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>Who goes first?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The first player is randomnly selected by your group. That player gets the first-player token and will kick off the game.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do you win?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The player with the most points wins. Tally up points for the following and determine the winner:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Points based on bird cards played on your tableau</li>\r\n<li>Points for bonus card(s) accomplished</li>\r\n<li>Points for end-of-round goals</li>\r\n<li>1 point for each:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Egg on a bird card</li>\r\n<li>Food token cached on a bird card</li>\r\n<li>Card tucked under a bird card</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In case of a tie, number of unused food tokens serve as tiebreaker. If still tied, they share the victory.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What's inside the box?</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>170 unique bird cards (57x87mm)</li>\r\n<li>26 bonus cards (57x87mm)</li>\r\n<li>16 Automa cards (57x87mm)</li>\r\n<li>103 food tokens</li>\r\n<li>75 egg miniatures</li>\r\n<li>5 custom wooden dice</li>\r\n<li>5 player mats</li>\r\n<li>1 birdfeeder dice tower</li>\r\n<li>2-piece Game Trayz custom tray</li>\r\n<li>1 goal mat</li>\r\n<li>8 goal tiles</li>\r\n<li>1 first-player token</li>\r\n<li>40 action cubes (8 per player)</li>\r\n<li>1 scorepad (50 sheets; 1 sheet used for all players each game)</li>\r\n<li>3 rulebooks</li>\r\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>Gloomhaven is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world.<br /><br />Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.<br /><br />This is a legacy game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.</p>",

Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world.  Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.  This is a legacy game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.

        "description": "<p>In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete in doing the best work, with victory points awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar systems and other commendable achievements. The players acquire unique project cards, which represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. You compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles and greenery tiles. When the terraforming process is complete, the player corporation with the most victory points wins.</p>",
        "commentary": "<p>FryxGames, the makers of Terraforming Mars, is a family business run by 5 brothers out of a family of 10 brothers, 6 sisters, and 2 parents. Even outside of the 5 brothers, most of the family is involved in the creation process one way or the other.</p>",

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete in doing the best work, with victory points awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar systems and other commendable achievements. The players acquire unique project cards, which represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. You compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles and greenery tiles. When the terraforming process is complete, the player corporation with the most victory points wins. "

        "description": "<p>After five years of Pandemic, hundreds of thousands of players have contracted the virus! To celebrate this milestone, Pandemic has been completely re-designed. With new artwork by Chris Quilliams (Clash of Cultures, Merchants &amp; Marauders), Pandemic will now have a more modern look, inside and outside the box. With two new characters (the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist) face the game in ways you never thought possible as brand-new, virulent challenges await you!</p>\r\n<p>In <em><strong>Pandemic</strong></em>, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.</p>\r\n<p>The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are <em>Epidemic!</em> cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.</p>\r\n<p>Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!</p>\r\n<p>The 2013 edition of <em>Pandemic</em> includes two new characters—the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist—not available in earlier editions of the game.</p>\r\n<h4>Artists:</h4>\r\n<p>Joshua Cappel (graphics and illustration)</p>\r\n<p>Régis Moulun (cover painting)</p>\r\n<p>Chris Quilliams (2013 edition)<br /><br /><br /></p>",

        "description_preview": " After five years of Pandemic, hundreds of thousands of players have contracted the virus! To celebrate this milestone, Pandemic has been completely re-designed. With new artwork by Chris Quilliams (Clash of Cultures, Merchants & Marauders), Pandemic will now have a more modern look, inside and outside the box. With two new characters (the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist) face the game in ways you never thought possible as brand-new, virulent challenges await you! \r\n In   Pandemic  , several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand. \r\n The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are  Epidemic!  cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the \"normal\" spread of the infections. \r\n Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win! \r\n The 2013 edition of  Pandemic  includes two new characters—the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist—not available in earlier editions of the game. \r\n Artists: \r\n Joshua Cappel (graphics and illustration) \r\n Régis Moulun (cover painting) \r\n Chris Quilliams (2013 edition)    "

Spymasters give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. Their teammates try to guess words of the right color while avoiding those that belong to the opposing team.

        "faq": "<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>\r\n<p><strong>How do you eplain this game?</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is a word-guessing game where two opposing teams compete to get in contact with all of their secret agents first by discovering their codenames. Each team has an assigned Spymaster who possesses a key card that reveals the location of all of the team's agents, and they must give a one word clue to help the team discover their agents. Take a risk by offering a clue that will point to as many of the secret agents, but you may unintentionally alert the assassin instead. (Here are the <a href=\"https://czechgames.com/files/rules/codenames-rules-en.pdf\">official rules in PDF</a>.)</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is the best version to buy?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The soaring popularity of Codenames spawned more than 11 different versions to choose from including Marvel, Harry Potter, Disney, and more. If you're looking for the best version that will strike a chord with the most diverse set of crowds, start with the original Codenames. If you're looking for a solid 2-player cooperative experience, get <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/9e0nNBNyOU/codenames-duet\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: '9e0nNBNyOU', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Codenames: Duet</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How can I play online with my friends?</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://codenames.game/\">Codenames Online</a> is the official free-to-play digital adaptation of the board game. Create a room, send the invite link, and catch up with friends and families by playing a fun board game alongside your usual Zoom meetings.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can you play with 2 players?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The official rules include a 2-player variant to allow cooperative play against a simulated opponent. You can try this out even with a large group if they're not in the mood for competitive play. If you're looking for a strictly 2-player game, then I'd recommend <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/9e0nNBNyOU/codenames-duet\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: '9e0nNBNyOU', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Codenames: Duet</a>, which was specifically designed for a low player count.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How many guesses do you get every turn?</strong></p>\r\n<p>In every turn, the spymaster will say a one-word clue and a number, which tells the team how many codenames are associated with the clue. The team is allowed as many guesses as that number plus one extra. Taking this risk is a big part of the fun!</p>",

        "description": "<p>The world is on the brink of disaster. In Pandemic Legacy, your disease-fighting team must keep four deadly diseases at bay for a whole year. Each month will bring new surprises, and your actions in each game will have repercussions on the next. Will you let cities fall to the diseases? Will your team be enough to keep the viruses at bay for a whole year? Craft your own unique Pandemic experience with Pandemic Legacy.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Pandemic Legacy</strong></em> is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic <em><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic\">Pandemic</a></em>, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.</p>\r\n<p>During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.</p>\r\n<p>After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.</p>\r\n<p>Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.</p>\r\n<p>During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.</p>",

        "description_preview": " The world is on the brink of disaster. In Pandemic Legacy, your disease-fighting team must keep four deadly diseases at bay for a whole year. Each month will bring new surprises, and your actions in each game will have repercussions on the next. Will you let cities fall to the diseases? Will your team be enough to keep the viruses at bay for a whole year? Craft your own unique Pandemic experience with Pandemic Legacy. \r\n   Pandemic Legacy   is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic   Pandemic  , in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand. \r\n During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions. \r\n After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to. \r\n Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards. \r\n During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play. "

The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who can fulfill their Destination Tickets by connecting two distant cities, and to the player who builds the longest continuous railway. So climb aboard for some railroading fun and adventure. You've got a Ticket to Ride!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOctober 2, 1900 -- it's 28 years to the day that noted London eccentric, Phileas Fogg accepted and then won a 20,000 bet that he could travel Around the World in 80 Days. Now at the dawn of the century some old friends have gathered to celebrate Fogg's impetuous and lucrative gamble -- and to propose a new wager of their own. The stakes: $1 million in a winner-takes-all competition. The objective: to see the most cities in North America -- in just 7 days. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Spiel Des Jahres 2004(German game of the year)<br />\r\n-As d'Or Cannes 2004 (French game of the year)<br />\r\n-Game of the year 2004 - Japan<br />\r\n-Game of the year 2004 - Sweden<br />\r\n-Game of the year 2004 - Finland<br />\r\n-Diana Jones Excellence in Gaming Award 2004<br />\r\n-Origins Award Winner - Best Board Game 2005<br />\r\n-Game of the year 2004 - Spain<br />\r\n-Parent's Choice Foundation Silver Medal 2004",

        "description_preview": "Ticket to Ride is a cross-country train adventure game. Players collect train cards that enable them to claim railway routes connecting cities throughout North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who can fulfill their Destination Tickets by connecting two distant cities, and to the player who builds the longest continuous railway. So climb aboard for some railroading fun and adventure. You've got a Ticket to Ride! \r\n \r\nOctober 2, 1900 -- it's 28 years to the day that noted London eccentric, Phileas Fogg accepted and then won a 20,000 bet that he could travel Around the World in 80 Days. Now at the dawn of the century some old friends have gathered to celebrate Fogg's impetuous and lucrative gamble -- and to propose a new wager of their own. The stakes: $1 million in a winner-takes-all competition. The objective: to see the most cities in North America -- in just 7 days.  \r\n \r\n-Spiel Des Jahres 2004(German game of the year) \r\n-As d'Or Cannes 2004 (French game of the year) \r\n-Game of the year 2004 - Japan \r\n-Game of the year 2004 - Sweden \r\n-Game of the year 2004 - Finland \r\n-Diana Jones Excellence in Gaming Award 2004 \r\n-Origins Award Winner - Best Board Game 2005 \r\n-Game of the year 2004 - Spain \r\n-Parent's Choice Foundation Silver Medal 2004"

        "description": "<p>As a wealthy Renaissance merchant, acquire mines and transportation, hire artisans and woo the nobility. Create the most fantastic jewelry to become the best-known merchant of them all! Acquire precious stones to trade them for development cards. Use development cards to acquire more gem stones. Use your gems and gold to create the most fantastic jewelry, and appeal to the nobles to gain the prestige you need to win.<br /><br />Splendor is a fast-paced and addictive game of chip-collecting and card development. Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops; all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.<br /><br />On your turn, you may (1) collect chips (gems), or (2) buy and build a card, or (3) reserve one card. If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card, you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.<br /><br />All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do.</p>",

Create the most fantastic jewelry to become the best-known merchant of them all! Acquire precious stones to trade them for development cards. Use development cards to acquire more gem stones. Use your gems and gold to create the most fantastic jewelry, and appeal to the nobles to gain the prestige you need to win.  Splendor is a fast-paced and addictive game of chip-collecting and card development. Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops; all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.  On your turn, you may (1) collect chips (gems), or (2) buy and build a card, or (3) reserve one card. If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card, you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.  All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do. "

        "description": "<p>Within the charming valley of Everdell, beneath the boughs of towering trees, among meandering streams and mossy hollows, a civilization of forest critters is thriving and expanding. From Everfrost to Bellsong, many a year have come and gone, but the time has come for new territories to be settled and new cities established. You will be the leader of a group of critters intent on just such a task. There are buildings to construct, lively characters to meet, events to host - you have a busy year ahead of yourself. Will the sun shine brightest on your city before the winter moon rises? <br /><br />Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement.<br /><br />On their turn a player can take one of three actions:<br />a) Place a Worker: Each player has a collection of Worker pieces. These are placed on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Workers perform various actions to further the development of a player's tableau: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.<br />b) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.<br />c) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added. The game is played from Winter through to the onset of the following winter, at which point the player with the city with the most points wins.</p>",

        "description_preview": " Within the charming valley of Everdell, beneath the boughs of towering trees, among meandering streams and mossy hollows, a civilization of forest critters is thriving and expanding. From Everfrost to Bellsong, many a year have come and gone, but the time has come for new territories to be settled and new cities established. You will be the leader of a group of critters intent on just such a task. There are buildings to construct, lively characters to meet, events to host - you have a busy year ahead of yourself. Will the sun shine brightest on your city before the winter moon rises?   Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement.  On their turn a player can take one of three actions: a) Place a Worker: Each player has a collection of Worker pieces. These are placed on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Workers perform various actions to further the development of a player's tableau: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions. b) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities. c) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added. The game is played from Winter through to the onset of the following winter, at which point the player with the city with the most points wins. "

        "description": "<p><em><strong>Brass: Birmingham</strong></em> is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace's 2007 masterpiece, <em>Brass</em>. <em>Birmingham</em> tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.</p>\r\n<p>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.</p>\r\n<p>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):</p>\r\n<p>1) <strong>Build</strong> - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br />2) <strong>Network</strong> - Add a rail/canal link, expanding your network.<br />3) <strong>Develop</strong> - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br />4) <strong>Sell</strong> - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br />5) <strong>Loan</strong> - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income.</p>\r\n<p><em>Brass: Birmingham</em> also features a new sixth action:</p>\r\n<p>6) <strong>Scout</strong> - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original <em>Brass</em>.)</p>\r\n<p>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.</p>\r\n<p><em>Birmingham</em> features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.</p>\r\n<p>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original <em>Brass</em> as well as in <em>Brass: Birmingham</em>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>New &quot;Sell&quot; system</strong></p>\r\n<p>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.</p>\r\n<p><em>Birmingham</em> features three all-new industry types:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Brewery</strong> - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Manufactured goods</strong> - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pottery</strong> - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Increased Coal and Iron Market size</strong> - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.</p>\r\n<p><em>Brass: Birmingham</em> is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.</p>",

        "description_preview": "   Brass: Birmingham   is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace's 2007 masterpiece,  Brass .  Birmingham  tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870. \r\n As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. \r\n Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game): \r\n 1)  Build  - Pay required resources and place an industry tile. 2)  Network  - Add a rail/canal link, expanding your network. 3)  Develop  - Increase the VP value of an industry. 4)  Sell  - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery. 5)  Loan  - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income. \r\n  Brass: Birmingham  also features a new sixth action: \r\n 6)  Scout  - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original  Brass .) \r\n The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles. \r\n  Birmingham  features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement. \r\n Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original  Brass  as well as in  Brass: Birmingham . \r\n  New \"Sell\" system  \r\n Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also \"grease the wheels of industry\" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer. \r\n  Birmingham  features three all-new industry types: \r\n  Brewery  - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods. \r\n  Manufactured goods  - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton. \r\n  Pottery  - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan. \r\n  Increased Coal and Iron Market size  - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon. \r\n  Brass: Birmingham  is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. "

        "description": "<p>The women and men of your expedition build the first two settlements. Fortunately, the land is rich in natural resources. You build roads and new settlements that eventually become cities. Will you succeed in gaining supremacy on Catan? Barter trade dominates the scene. Some resources you have in abundance, other resources are scarce. Ore for wool, brick for lumber - you trade according to what is needed for your current building projects. Proceed strategically! If you found your settlements in the right places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor. But your opponents are smart too.</p>\r\n<p>To begin the game, we build the game board using hexagonal terrain tiles. Catan is born - a beautiful island with mountains, pastures, hills, fields, and forests, surrounded by the sea.</p>\r\n<p>Each of us places two small houses on spaces where three terrain hexes meet. They are our starting settlements.</p>\r\n<p>And so it begins. I roll two dice. An “11”! Each terrain hex is marked with a die roll number. Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool.</p>\r\n<p>We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents.</p>\r\n<p>Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points. If you expand cleverly, you may be the first player to reach 10 victory points and thus win the game!</p>",

        "description_preview": " The women and men of your expedition build the first two settlements. Fortunately, the land is rich in natural resources. You build roads and new settlements that eventually become cities. Will you succeed in gaining supremacy on Catan? Barter trade dominates the scene. Some resources you have in abundance, other resources are scarce. Ore for wool, brick for lumber - you trade according to what is needed for your current building projects. Proceed strategically! If you found your settlements in the right places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor. But your opponents are smart too. \r\n To begin the game, we build the game board using hexagonal terrain tiles. Catan is born - a beautiful island with mountains, pastures, hills, fields, and forests, surrounded by the sea. \r\n Each of us places two small houses on spaces where three terrain hexes meet. They are our starting settlements. \r\n And so it begins. I roll two dice. An “11”! Each terrain hex is marked with a die roll number. Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool. \r\n We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents. \r\n Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points. If you expand cleverly, you may be the first player to reach 10 victory points and thus win the game! "

        "description": "<p>Patchwork is a form of needlework that involves sewing together pieces of fabric into a larger design. In the past, it was a way to make use of leftover pieces of cloth to create clothing and quilts. Today, patchwork is a form of art, in which the designers use precious fabrics to create beautiful textiles. The use of uneven pieces of fabric in particular can result in real masterpieces and is therefore being practiced by a large number of textile artists.<br /><br />To create a beautiful quilt, however, requires effort and time, but the available patches just do not want to fit together. So choose your patches carefully and keep a healthy supply of buttons to not only finish your quilt, but to make it better and more beautiful than your opponent's.</p>",

        "description_preview": " Patchwork is a form of needlework that involves sewing together pieces of fabric into a larger design. In the past, it was a way to make use of leftover pieces of cloth to create clothing and quilts. Today, patchwork is a form of art, in which the designers use precious fabrics to create beautiful textiles. The use of uneven pieces of fabric in particular can result in real masterpieces and is therefore being practiced by a large number of textile artists.  To create a beautiful quilt, however, requires effort and time, but the available patches just do not want to fit together. So choose your patches carefully and keep a healthy supply of buttons to not only finish your quilt, but to make it better and more beautiful than your opponent's. "

Be it changing the rules for how you can build or move, changing how you interact with other players, or providing you with an alternate victory condition, the 30 different god powers are sure to make every game of  Santorini  different and exciting! \r\n "

Each round consists of one or more of five possible phases. In each round, each player secretly and simultaneously chooses one of seven different action cards and then reveals it. Only the selected phases occur. For these phases, every player performs the phasea€s action, while the selecting player(s) also get a bonus for that phase. For example, if at least one player chooses the Develop action, then the Develop phase will occur, otherwise it is skipped. In it, each player may simultaneously select a development from his hand of cards to build. After revealing the cards, each player adds his development to his tableau of cards on the table and then discards cards from his hand equal to its cost. Each player who chose Develop discards one card fewer as his bonus. Explore allows a player to draw cards and select which of them to add to his hand. Settle allows a player to place a world in his tableau. Some worlds produce goods, represented by face down cards, when Produce is selected. These goods can be discarded for victory points or sold to add cards to the player's hand by selecting Consume. With cards, players can settle new worlds and build more developments, gaining both victory points and card powers that provide advantages in certain phases. The player who best manages his cards, phase and bonus selections, and card powers to build the greatest space empire, wins. The winner is the player with the most victory points.</p>",

Finding the right balance between risk and reward is key. \r\n  Winner of the 2018 Gamer  's Game of the Year in Germany   (the Kennerspiel des Jahres - considered the Oscar of boardgames)  "

        "description": "<div>\r\n<p>This ain't your average, everyday Euro game! Welcome to the Great Western Trail, where players take on the role of cattle drivers attempting to wrangle their herd to market. The trail will be tough, and countless hazards await you. Can you make it to the end of your journey and turn a tidy profit? Find out in Great Western Trail!<br /><br /><strong>Simple Mechanics, Complex Decisions</strong><br />Turns in Great Western Trail are broken into three simple phases that will carry you through the entire game. These simple phases belie a web of deep and complex decisions players will face as they make their way down the trail. The mechanics are simple, but mastering the trail is where the fun lies.<br /><br /><strong>Make Your Move!</strong><br />A turn starts by moving your cattleman down the trail. The number of spaces a player is allowed to move is dictated by their player board, and there are hazards a plenty all along the trail. Wherever you end up, the next phase is ...<br /><br /><strong>Take Action!</strong><br />When a player ends their movement, they perform the action listed on the space they ended on. Depending on where you land, you will have different options available to you. Neutral locations or buildings you own will allow you to perform a special action specific to that location or a single auxiliary action. On locations owned by other players, hazard tiles, or teepee tiles, your only option is to use an auxiliary action. Last, there's Kansas City!<br /><br /><strong>Kansas City or Bust!</strong><br />Landing on Kansas City sets off a series of subphases that must be resolved in order: Three Foresight phases, the Income Phase, and the Delivery Phase. The Foresight subphases give players a choice between two tiles to add to the board (hazard, teepee, or worker). These tiles will affect future trips down the trail, so choose wisely. Earn income from your journey down the trail by revealing and discarding your hand. Finally, choose a city to deliver your cattle to. This leg of your journey is over. Now it's time to do it all again!<br /><br /><strong>Draw!</strong><br />Draw up to your hand limit and your turn is over! Time to start planning your next move and figure out the choices you'll face in the coming turns.</p>\r\n</div>",

        "description_preview": " \r\n This ain't your average, everyday Euro game! Welcome to the Great Western Trail, where players take on the role of cattle drivers attempting to wrangle their herd to market. The trail will be tough, and countless hazards await you. Can you make it to the end of your journey and turn a tidy profit? Find out in Great Western Trail!   Simple Mechanics, Complex Decisions  Turns in Great Western Trail are broken into three simple phases that will carry you through the entire game. These simple phases belie a web of deep and complex decisions players will face as they make their way down the trail. The mechanics are simple, but mastering the trail is where the fun lies.   Make Your Move!  A turn starts by moving your cattleman down the trail. The number of spaces a player is allowed to move is dictated by their player board, and there are hazards a plenty all along the trail. Wherever you end up, the next phase is ...   Take Action!  When a player ends their movement, they perform the action listed on the space they ended on. Depending on where you land, you will have different options available to you. Neutral locations or buildings you own will allow you to perform a special action specific to that location or a single auxiliary action. On locations owned by other players, hazard tiles, or teepee tiles, your only option is to use an auxiliary action. Last, there's Kansas City!   Kansas City or Bust!  Landing on Kansas City sets off a series of subphases that must be resolved in order: Three Foresight phases, the Income Phase, and the Delivery Phase. The Foresight subphases give players a choice between two tiles to add to the board (hazard, teepee, or worker). These tiles will affect future trips down the trail, so choose wisely. Earn income from your journey down the trail by revealing and discarding your hand. Finally, choose a city to deliver your cattle to. This leg of your journey is over. Now it's time to do it all again!   Draw!  Draw up to your hand limit and your turn is over! Time to start planning your next move and figure out the choices you'll face in the coming turns. \r\n "

In this game, the players are powerful lords vying for control of this great city. Its treasures and resources are ripe for the taking, and that which cannot be gained through trickery and negotiation must be taken by force! \r\n In   Lords of Waterdeep  , a strategy board game for 2-5 players, you take on the role of one of the masked Lords of Waterdeep, secret rulers of the city. Through your agents, you recruit adventurers to go on quests on your behalf, earning rewards and increasing your influence over the city. Expand the city by purchasing new buildings that open up new actions on the board, and hinder – or help – the other lords by playing Intrigue cards to enact your carefully laid plans. \r\n During the course of play, you may gain points or resources through completing quests, constructing buildings, playing intrigue cards or having other players utilize the buildings you have constructed. At the end of 8 rounds of play, the player who has accrued the most points wins the game. \r\n  Lords of Waterdeep  is a Euro-style board game for 2-5 players.  Components:  Game board  Rulebook  5 card stock player mats  121 Intrigue, Quest, and Role cards  130 wooden cubes, pawns, and score pieces  Wooden player markers  Card stock tiles and tokens representing buildings, gold coins, and victory points "

        "description": "<p>All of the eligible young men (and many of the not-so-young) seek to woo the princess of Tempest. Unfortunately, she has locked herself in the Palace, and you must rely on others to bring your romantic letters to her. Will yours reach her first?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Love Letter</strong> is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2 to 4 players. Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Munchkin Loot Letter:</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Steal the treasure and backstab your friends - without all of the silly card-playing stuff. Well, without some of it. OK, without all but 16 cards of it, at least. <em>Munchkin Loot Letter</em> is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2-4 players.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Love Letter: Legend of the Five Rings:</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Love and Honor. A vision of loveliness and poise, Iweko Miaka’s position of princess in the Imperial family ensures her betrothal will be a great contest for the samurai clans of the Emerald Empire. Whichever clan can win her as a wife for one of their young samurai will secure standing and glory for decades to come. And though the marriage may be political, what better way to influence the decision than by winning the heart of the princess herself?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Letters to Santa:</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you want all of your Christmas wishes brought by the big guy, you’ll need to make sure your letter makes it to him. The closer you get the letter to Santa, the more likely you are to win! But watch out for the wily Krampus, out to dash your yuletide dreams!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Letters to Santa</strong> is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2–4 players. Your goal is to get your letter into Santa's hands while deflecting the letters from others.

Unfortunately, she has locked herself in the Palace, and you must rely on others to bring your romantic letters to her. Will yours reach her first? \r\n  Love Letter  is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2 to 4 players. Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire. \r\n   Munchkin Loot Letter:   \r\n Steal the treasure and backstab your friends - without all of the silly card-playing stuff. Well, without some of it. OK, without all but 16 cards of it, at least.  Munchkin Loot Letter  is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2-4 players. \r\n   Love Letter: Legend of the Five Rings:   \r\n Love and Honor. A vision of loveliness and poise, Iweko Miaka’s position of princess in the Imperial family ensures her betrothal will be a great contest for the samurai clans of the Emerald Empire. Whichever clan can win her as a wife for one of their young samurai will secure standing and glory for decades to come. And though the marriage may be political, what better way to influence the decision than by winning the heart of the princess herself? \r\n  Letters to Santa:  \r\n If you want all of your Christmas wishes brought by the big guy, you’ll need to make sure your letter makes it to him. The closer you get the letter to Santa, the more likely you are to win! But watch out for the wily Krampus, out to dash your yuletide dreams! \r\n  Letters to Santa  is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2–4 players. Your goal is to get your letter into Santa's hands while deflecting the letters from others.

Each turn you will connect a new domino to your existing kingdom, making sure that at least one of its sides connects to a matching element already in play.  Make sure to include dominoes with crowns on them, because at the end of the game you will score points equal to the total number of matching elements multiplied by the number of crowns. \r\n In the Giant edition, each domino is 3.12 x 6.25 inches and each wooden king meeple is 2 inches tall!  "

        "description": "<p>Architects of the West Kingdom is set at the end of the Carolingian Empire, circa 850 AD. As royal architects, players compete to impress their King and maintain their noble status by constructing various landmarks throughout his newly appointed domain.</p>\r\n<p>Players will need to collect raw materials, hire apprentices and keep a watchful eye on their workforce. These are treacherous times. Rival architects will stop at nothing to slow your progress. Will you remain virtuous, or be found in the company of thieves and black marketeers?<br /><br />The aim of Architects of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the game's end. Points are gained by constructing various Buildings and advancing work on the Archbishop's Cathedral. Throughout the game, players will need to make a lot of moral decisions. However, only at the game's end will their virtue be judged. A few underhanded deals here and there might not seem like much, but fall too far and you will be punished. The game ends once a set number of constructions have been completed.</p>",

        "description_preview": " Architects of the West Kingdom is set at the end of the Carolingian Empire, circa 850 AD. As royal architects, players compete to impress their King and maintain their noble status by constructing various landmarks throughout his newly appointed domain. \r\n Players will need to collect raw materials, hire apprentices and keep a watchful eye on their workforce. These are treacherous times. Rival architects will stop at nothing to slow your progress. Will you remain virtuous, or be found in the company of thieves and black marketeers?  The aim of Architects of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the game's end. Points are gained by constructing various Buildings and advancing work on the Archbishop's Cathedral. Throughout the game, players will need to make a lot of moral decisions. However, only at the game's end will their virtue be judged. A few underhanded deals here and there might not seem like much, but fall too far and you will be punished. The game ends once a set number of constructions have been completed. "

        "description": "<p>In Blood Rage, each player controls their own Viking clan's warriors, leader, and ship. Ragnarok has come, and it's the end of the world! It's the Vikings' last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin's side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfil quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnarok, the ultimate inescapable doom. Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &quot;Gods' Gifts&quot; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner. Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents' strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponents' actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!</p>",

        "description_preview": " In Blood Rage, each player controls their own Viking clan's warriors, leader, and ship. Ragnarok has come, and it's the end of the world! It's the Vikings' last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin's side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfil quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnarok, the ultimate inescapable doom. Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These \"Gods' Gifts\" grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner. Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents' strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponents' actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death! "

You need followers and their abilities to expand your dominance by putting them to work as traders, builders, and scientists. Knights expand your scope of action and secure your mercantile expeditions. Craftsmen build trading stations and tools to facilitate work. Scholars make progress in science, and last but not least it cannot hurt to get active in monasteries since with monks on your side you are much less likely to fall prey to fate. \r\n In   Orléans  , you will always want to take more actions than possible, and there are many paths to victory. The challenge is to combine all elements as best as possible with regard to your strategy. \r\n \r\n\r\n "

        "description": "<p><strong>Small World</strong> is designed by Philippe Keyaerts and is a fantasy-themed game similar in game play to his Vinci, which was released in 1999 by French publisher Descartes.</p>\r\n<p>In Small World, players will be able to control characters from 14 fantasy races - dwarves, giants, orcs, elves, and so forth - while trying to take control of territory and push opponents out of adjacent lands and off the map. Even while dominating opponents, however, you have to keep in mind that your race's civilization is doomed as well, thanks to the passing of time and attacking of neighbors, so be ready to cast aside one tribe while taking the reins of another in order to keep dominating the world.<br /><br />Small World is for 2-5 players and contains two double-sided gameboards, with one side being used for each of the different number of possible players. The 14 fantasy races come with matching banners and tokens, and the game also includes 20 special power badges to further customize the races along with mountains, troll lairs, fortresses, holes-in-the-ground, victory coins. and other items.</p>",

        "description_preview": "  Small World  is designed by Philippe Keyaerts and is a fantasy-themed game similar in game play to his Vinci, which was released in 1999 by French publisher Descartes. \r\n In Small World, players will be able to control characters from 14 fantasy races - dwarves, giants, orcs, elves, and so forth - while trying to take control of territory and push opponents out of adjacent lands and off the map. Even while dominating opponents, however, you have to keep in mind that your race's civilization is doomed as well, thanks to the passing of time and attacking of neighbors, so be ready to cast aside one tribe while taking the reins of another in order to keep dominating the world.  Small World is for 2-5 players and contains two double-sided gameboards, with one side being used for each of the different number of possible players. The 14 fantasy races come with matching banners and tokens, and the game also includes 20 special power badges to further customize the races along with mountains, troll lairs, fortresses, holes-in-the-ground, victory coins. and other items.

        "description": "<p>The Maya were a highly developed civilization known for its unique art, complex architecture, sophisticated mathematics and advanced knowledge of the stars. At the heart of their society was a mysterious calendar - Tzolk'in. With a length of 260 days, it could predict the right time to plant seeds, the time to build monuments, the day a new baby would be born as well as the movement of the planets. It was the centerpiece of the Mayan cycle of life.<br /><br />We invite you to become one of the ajaw, the leaders of Mayan tribes. Please the gods and lead your clan to prosperity!<br /><br />As in the life of ancient Maya, the center of our game is the Tzolk'in calendar - a set of gears that rotate each round of the game. This unique system helps you to visualize the cyclic flow of time and plan your actions in advance. Harvest crops now, or wait for them to grow a little more for higher yield? All will be clear to see on the wheels of time.</p>",

At the heart of their society was a mysterious calendar - Tzolk'in. With a length of 260 days, it could predict the right time to plant seeds, the time to build monuments, the day a new baby would be born as well as the movement of the planets. It was the centerpiece of the Mayan cycle of life.  We invite you to become one of the ajaw, the leaders of Mayan tribes. Please the gods and lead your clan to prosperity!  As in the life of ancient Maya, the center of our game is the Tzolk'in calendar - a set of gears that rotate each round of the game. This unique system helps you to visualize the cyclic flow of time and plan your actions in advance. Harvest crops now, or wait for them to grow a little more for higher yield? All will be clear to see on the wheels of time. "

        "description": "<p>Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. The latest cooperative publishing effort from Friedemann Friese and Rio Grande Games, removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original editionwhile retaining the fluctuating commodities market like McMulti and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.<br /><br />The object of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark preexisting routes between cities for connection, and then vie against other players to purchase the power plants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you?re potentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely by purchasing at all. <br /><br />Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants (except for the highly valuable renewable energy wind/solar plants), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Power Grid: Recharged Edition</strong> will replace Power Grid. Small but meaningful improvements have been made to the game including updated rules to improve game play, an updated player order tracker, new reference cards, and a discount token to enhance power plant auctions. Power Grid: Recharged Edition will be compatible with all previous Power Grid expansions.</p>",

        "description_preview": " Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. The latest cooperative publishing effort from Friedemann Friese and Rio Grande Games, removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original editionwhile retaining the fluctuating commodities market like McMulti and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.  The object of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark preexisting routes between cities for connection, and then vie against other players to purchase the power plants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you?re potentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely by purchasing at all.   Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants (except for the highly valuable renewable energy wind/solar plants), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes. \r\n  Power Grid: Recharged Edition  will replace Power Grid. Small but meaningful improvements have been made to the game including updated rules to improve game play, an updated player order tracker, new reference cards, and a discount token to enhance power plant auctions. Power Grid: Recharged Edition will be compatible with all previous Power Grid expansions. "

        "description": "<p>Something evil stirs in Arkham, and only you can stop it.</p>\r\n<p>Blurring the traditional lines between roleplaying and card game experiences, <strong>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</strong> is the living card game of love craft I an mystery, monsters, and madness!</p>\r\n<p>You and your friend (or up to three friends with two core sets) become characters within the quiet new England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult. No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, each of your adventures in Arkham Horror: The Card Game carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the ancient ones straining against the barriers to our world… the basic mode of play in Arkham Horror: The Card Game is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground.</p>\r\n<p>All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand. And your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you.</p>",

        "description_preview": " Something evil stirs in Arkham, and only you can stop it. \r\n Blurring the traditional lines between roleplaying and card game experiences,  Arkham Horror: The Card Game  is the living card game of love craft I an mystery, monsters, and madness! \r\n You and your friend (or up to three friends with two core sets) become characters within the quiet new England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult. No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries. \r\n Meanwhile, each of your adventures in Arkham Horror: The Card Game carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the ancient ones straining against the barriers to our world… the basic mode of play in Arkham Horror: The Card Game is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground. \r\n All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand. And your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you. "

Each player leads a faction of survivors with dozens of different characters in the game.<br /><br />Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition--but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or worst of all: vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's only looking out for their own interests!</p>",

Each player leads a faction of survivors with dozens of different characters in the game.  Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition--but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or worst of all: vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's only looking out for their own interests! "

        "description": "<p>In this fast-playing card game, the goal is to grab the best combination of sushi dishes as they whiz by. Score points for making the most maki rolls or for collecting a full set of sashimi. Dip your favorite nigiri in wasabi to triple its value! But be sure to leave room for dessert or else you'll eat into your score! Gather the most points and consider yourself the sushi master!</p>\r\n<p><em>Sushi Go!</em> takes the card-drafting mechanism of <em>Fairy Tale</em> and <em>7 Wonders</em> and distills it into a twenty-minute game that anyone can play. The dynamics of &quot;draft and pass&quot; are brought to the fore, while keeping the rules to a minimum. As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of sushi you'll go for. Then, each turn you'll need to weigh which cards to keep and which to pass on. The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays and nasty blocks. Round to round, you must also keep your eye on the goal of having the most pudding cards at the end of the game!</p>",
        "commentary": "<p>Sushi Go! quickly became a game about sushi once Phil Walker-Harding made the connection between passing cards around the table and seeing dishes move around a sushi train (if you're curious, check out the <a href=\"/forum/WbnHpdyNiO/why-phil-walkerharding-created-a-game-about-sushi-a-look-at-sushi-go-imhotep--more\" target=\"_blank\">full interview with Phil</a>)</p>",

Score points for making the most maki rolls or for collecting a full set of sashimi. Dip your favorite nigiri in wasabi to triple its value! But be sure to leave room for dessert or else you'll eat into your score! Gather the most points and consider yourself the sushi master! \r\n  Sushi Go!  takes the card-drafting mechanism of  Fairy Tale  and  7 Wonders  and distills it into a twenty-minute game that anyone can play. The dynamics of \"draft and pass\" are brought to the fore, while keeping the rules to a minimum. As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of sushi you'll go for. Then, each turn you'll need to weigh which cards to keep and which to pass on. The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays and nasty blocks. Round to round, you must also keep your eye on the goal of having the most pudding cards at the end of the game! "

From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. </p><p>Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete and does not require the original version. More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponents route to connect yours. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces. The overall goal remains the same, collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game wins.</p><p>-International Gamers Award 2005<br /></p>",

From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers.   Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete and does not require the original version. More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponents route to connect yours.  \r\n \r\nThe game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces. The overall goal remains the same, collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game wins.  -International Gamers Award 2005  "

You will have to find food, fight wild beasts, protect yourself from weather changes… \r\n Take the role of one of four characters from the ship crew (cook, carpenter, explorer or soldier) and face the adventure. Use your determination skills to help your team mates, discuss with them your plan and put it into practice. Debate, discuss, and work on the best plan you all can make. \r\n Search for treasures. Discover mysteries. Follow goals of six different, engaging scenarios. Start by building a big pile of wood and setting it on fire to call for help, and then start new adventures. Become an exorcist on cursed Island. Become a treasure hunter on Volcano Island. Become a rescue team for a young lady who’s stuck on rock island… \r\n In the 2016 edition players will find custom wooden pieced for all resources, thick cardboard player boards for each character, additional 7th scenario and what's most important, a completely rewritten rulebook.

As the cards are played, the expedition routes take shape and the explorers earn points. The most daring adventurers make bets on the success of their expeditions. The explorer with the highest score after three rounds of expeditions wins. The rules of the game are simple, but beware: The lost cities hold many unseen mysteries!</p>\r\n<p>Note: The 2019 edition came with a double sided game board and The Lost Expedition mini-expansion.</p>",

Two explorers embark on research journeys to remote corners of the world: the Himalayan mountains, the Central American rainforest, the Egyptian desert, a mysterious volcano, and the bottom of the sea. As the cards are played, the expedition routes take shape and the explorers earn points. The most daring adventurers make bets on the success of their expeditions. The explorer with the highest score after three rounds of expeditions wins. The rules of the game are simple, but beware: The lost cities hold many unseen mysteries! \r\n Note: The 2019 edition came with a double sided game board and The Lost Expedition mini-expansion. "

        "description": "<p>&quot;Star Wars: Rebellion is a board game of epic conflict between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance for two to four players! Experience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it. Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite! Contents include: 1 game board (split in 2 halves), 170 plastic miniatures, 25 leaders (with stands), 10 custom dice, Over 170 cards, 1 Learn to Play Booklet, 1 Rules Reference&quot;.</p>",

Experience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it. Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite! Contents include: 1 game board (split in 2 halves), 170 plastic miniatures, 25 leaders (with stands), 10 custom dice, Over 170 cards, 1 Learn to Play Booklet, 1 Rules Reference\". "

You must construct sanctuaries for spiritual enlightenment, erect citadels to protect peaceful clans, and indulge your wanderlust by exploring the surrounding territories.

Their mission: to farm parcels of land, irrigate them, and have green, yellow or pink bamboo grow.</p>\r\n<p>In turn, they see what the weather brings and perform two actions from among those offered to them: get a new plot of land or irrigation channel, grow bamboo, feed the panda or draw an objective card.</p>\r\n<p>The game ends when a player has completed 7 to 9 objectives (depending on the number of players). The player who gets the best score by adding the total value of their completed objective wins the game.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>Giant edition</strong> is the same game, in a super-sized format. Only 400 units were made available to the US market. The panda measures 4 3/8″ high and the gardener is 5 1/8&quot; high.

Their mission: to farm parcels of land, irrigate them, and have green, yellow or pink bamboo grow. \r\n In turn, they see what the weather brings and perform two actions from among those offered to them: get a new plot of land or irrigation channel, grow bamboo, feed the panda or draw an objective card. \r\n The game ends when a player has completed 7 to 9 objectives (depending on the number of players). The player who gets the best score by adding the total value of their completed objective wins the game. \r\n The  Giant edition  is the same game, in a super-sized format. Only 400 units were made available to the US market. The panda measures 4 3/8″ high and the gardener is 5 1/8\" high. Comes in a solid wooden box (12.4″ x 11.8″ x 10.2″). \r\n  Awards:  2012 Golden Geek Winner - Best Art and Presentation "

Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>The Resistance</strong></em> is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. <em>The Resistance</em> is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.</p>\r\n<p>Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players’ identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.</p>",

Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance! \r\n   The Resistance   is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination.  The Resistance  is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination. \r\n Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players’ identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game. "

Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion!   In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.  Rio Grande Games has updated Dominion in this Second Edition. New cover and replaced a few cards; cleaned up rules and card text. Artwork on the Base cards have been changed to be similar to that found previously in Base Cards. "

Having lost their ultimate weapon, the Empire scrambles to recover in the face of this crushing defeat.  \r\n  A  s the scattered fragments of the battle station rain down upon the Rebel base on Yavin 4, the Empire sets in motion a plan to seek retribution against Rebel forces stationed on the small moon.  \r\n   Not long after, when an Imperial beacon begins to broadcast from an outpost some distance away from the Rebel base, a small team of elite operatives is dispatched; their mission: to silence the signal at all costs…  \r\n In  Imperial Assault , 2-5 players join forces in an epic Star Wars adventure based on the Descent 2.0 system of combat and dungeon exploration. One player will control the Galactic Empire, pitting the Rebel Alliance against squadrons of Stormtroopers, deadly beasts, and even Darth Vader himself. The other players take control of Rebel Alliance Heroes, going on missions to continue their fight against the Empire. Can the Rebel Alliance work together to accomplish their missions, or will the Empire bring its forces to bear and squash the Rebellion? Find out in  Imperial Assault ! \r\n "

You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! <br /><br />In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.</p>\r\n<p>In <em><strong>Dominion</strong></em>, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &quot;buy&quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.</p>",

Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion!   In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. \r\n In   Dominion  , each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can \"buy\" as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.

        "description": "<p>Updated and streamlined for a new generation of players, <em>Agricola</em>, the award-winning and highly acclaimed game by Uwe Rosenberg, features a revised rulebook and gameplay, along with wood pieces and components for up to four players.</p>\r\n<p>The 17th Century Was Not an Easy Time to be a Farmer. A game for 1-4 players ages 12 and up; play time is 30 minutes per player. Amazing replay value. The Agricola base game is a revised edition of Uwe Rosenberg’s celebrated classic. The game is designed for 1-4 players, features improved all-wood components and a card selection from the base game as well as its expansions, revised and updated for this edition. Players begin the game with two family members and can grow their families over the course of the game. This allows them more actions but remember you have to grow more food to feed your family as it grows! Feeding your family is a special kind of challenge and players will plant grain and vegetables while supplementing their food supply with sheep, wild boar and cattle. Guide your family to wealth, health and prosperity and you will win the game.</p>",

        "description_preview": " Updated and streamlined for a new generation of players,  Agricola , the award-winning and highly acclaimed game by Uwe Rosenberg, features a revised rulebook and gameplay, along with wood pieces and components for up to four players. \r\n The 17th Century Was Not an Easy Time to be a Farmer. A game for 1-4 players ages 12 and up; play time is 30 minutes per player. Amazing replay value. The Agricola base game is a revised edition of Uwe Rosenberg’s celebrated classic. The game is designed for 1-4 players, features improved all-wood components and a card selection from the base game as well as its expansions, revised and updated for this edition. Players begin the game with two family members and can grow their families over the course of the game. This allows them more actions but remember you have to grow more food to feed your family as it grows! Feeding your family is a special kind of challenge and players will plant grain and vegetables while supplementing their food supply with sheep, wild boar and cattle. Guide your family to wealth, health and prosperity and you will win the game. "

But this is more difficult than expected in space.</p>\r\n<p>With each mission, the game becomes more difficult. After each mission, the game can be paused and continued later.

What about the rumors about the unknown planet about? The eventful journey through space extends over 50 exciting missions. But this game can only be defeated by meeting common individual tasks of each player. In order to meet the varied challenges, communication is essential in the team. But this is more difficult than expected in space. \r\n With each mission, the game becomes more difficult. After each mission, the game can be paused and continued later. During each mission, it is not the amount of tricks, but the right tricks at the right time that count. \r\n The team wins only if every single player is successful in fulfilling their tasks. \r\n The game comes with 50 missions. Three more missions were published in spielbox 2/2020 \r\n It is based on the mechanics of Tressette, that is a traditional Italian trick-taking card game. "

With each move a player relocates one worker to a new location, always choosing one of its two areas to perform an action (and upgrade their workforce), or a powerful bonus (but no upgrade). as the mysterious Twilight of teotihuacan approaches, players research technologies, raise the magnificent pyramid of the sun, build houses for the inhabitants of the city, collect precious masks, and climb the steps of three great temples to secure bonuses granted by the favour of the gods.

        "description": "<div>\r\n<p>Centuries ago, the spice trade was the most important market in the world. It established and destroyed empires, compelled men to explore the far corners of the earth, and led to the discovery of new worlds. At that time, the value of spices even rivaled that of gold! In the old days, they carried a sense of mystery and allure. Spice merchants would weave fantastic tales of danger to reach these spices in hopes of selling their wares at higher prices. In later centuries, the demand on spices became so great, that those who controlled the spices generated immense wealth and renown. It is at this time, you find yourself leading your caravan across the eastern lands to the Mediterranean Sea in search of wealth and fortune. As a caravan leader, your journey begins on the Spice Road. This is Century: Spice Road!<br /><br />In <strong>Century: Spice Road</strong>, players aim to collect and trade spices in order to acquire point cards and coins that are worth points at the end of the game. Players play cards from their hands to acquire spices for their caravan and trade those spices in for wealth and power (point cards and money), or to purchase new merchant cards to more efficiently acquire rare and valuable spices. Players take one action a turn until someone has acquired their fifth (or sixth in 2-3 player game) point card, players will finish out the current round of play and the person with the most points wins!<br /><br /><strong>Play or Acquire Cards</strong><br />At the start of the game, each player is given two merchant cards to start with and some preliminary spices. On their turn, each player may choose, as their action for the turn, to play a card from their hand, or spend spices to acquire a new merchant card from the row and place it in their hand. Merchant cards allow players to acquire new spices, exchange spices they currently have for different ones, or upgrade a spice to one worth more. Building up a good spice trading engine of merchant cards is an important part of succeeding on the Spice Road, so look out for powerful play sequences when taking new cards!<br /><br /><strong>Rest</strong><br />Once they've played all the cards from their hands, players must use their turn action to rest and return their cards to their hand. Now they'll be able to play their cards again on future turns, building up their caravan and further developing their hand of merchant cards to start acquiring point cards.<br /><br /><strong>Claim Point Cards</strong><br />The way to win in Century: Spice Road is to have the most points at the end of the game. Players get points when they acquire Point Cards and Coins by trading in their spices. Each point card in the row will have a different cost and overall point value listed on it, and the spice cost must be paid to acquire that card. If the two leftmost cards in the row are acquired, whoever acquired one of those point cards can take a coin from the pile above it. Silver coins are worth 1 point at the end of the game and gold coins are worth 3 points! Once a player has bought their fifth point card, the round of play finishes and a winner is crowned!</p>\r\n</div>",

        "description": "<p><em><strong>Paladins of the West Kingdom</strong></em> is set at a turbulent time of West Francia's story, circa 900 AD. Despite recent efforts to develop the city, outlying townships are still under threat from outsiders. Saracens scout the borders, while Vikings plunder wealth and livestock. Even the Byzantines from the east have shown their darker side.</p>\r\n<p>As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom, the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching.</p>\r\n<p>The aim of <em>Paladins of the West Kingdom</em> is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications, commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round, players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses, players will slowly increase their faith, strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score, but they will also determine the significance of their actions. The game is concluded at the end of the seventh round.</p>",

        "description_preview": "   Paladins of the West Kingdom   is set at a turbulent time of West Francia's story, circa 900 AD. Despite recent efforts to develop the city, outlying townships are still under threat from outsiders. Saracens scout the borders, while Vikings plunder wealth and livestock. Even the Byzantines from the east have shown their darker side. \r\n As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom, the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching. \r\n The aim of  Paladins of the West Kingdom  is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications, commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round, players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses, players will slowly increase their faith, strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score, but they will also determine the significance of their actions. The game is concluded at the end of the seventh round. "

Use hex-shaped building tiles to add residential, commercial, civic, and industrial areas, as well as special points of interest that provide benefits and take advantage of the resources of nearby towns. Your goal is to have your borough thrive and end up with a greater population than any of your opponents. <br /><br />Suburbia is a tile-laying game in which each player tries to build up an economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and encourage population growth. As your town grows, you'll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you'll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you'll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population).<br /><br />During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost - and the buildings available in each game vary, so you'll never play the same game twice!</p>",

Use hex-shaped building tiles to add residential, commercial, civic, and industrial areas, as well as special points of interest that provide benefits and take advantage of the resources of nearby towns. Your goal is to have your borough thrive and end up with a greater population than any of your opponents.   Suburbia is a tile-laying game in which each player tries to build up an economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and encourage population growth. As your town grows, you'll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you'll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you'll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population).  During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost - and the buildings available in each game vary, so you'll never play the same game twice! "

Who is capable of getting away with murder?</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In <em>Deception: Murder in Hong Kong</em>, players find themselves in a scenario of intrigue and murder, deduction and deception. One player is the Murderer, secretly choosing their weapon and the evidence they leave behind. Another is the Forensic Scientist who holds the key to convicting the criminal but is only able to express their knowledge through analysis of the scene. The rest are investigators, interpreting the clues to solve the crime – and the killer is among them. Investigators must collaborate and use their wits, their hunches, and their keen deductive insight to correctly identify the means of murder and the key evidence to convict the killer. The murderer must mislead and confuse the investigators to save themselves.</p>\r\n<p>Do you have what it takes to see through the lies and catch the criminal in your ranks or will they muddy the waters long enough to get away with murder?</p>\r\n</div>",

Who is capable of getting away with murder? \r\n \r\n In  Deception: Murder in Hong Kong , players find themselves in a scenario of intrigue and murder, deduction and deception. One player is the Murderer, secretly choosing their weapon and the evidence they leave behind. Another is the Forensic Scientist who holds the key to convicting the criminal but is only able to express their knowledge through analysis of the scene. The rest are investigators, interpreting the clues to solve the crime – and the killer is among them. Investigators must collaborate and use their wits, their hunches, and their keen deductive insight to correctly identify the means of murder and the key evidence to convict the killer. The murderer must mislead and confuse the investigators to save themselves. \r\n Do you have what it takes to see through the lies and catch the criminal in your ranks or will they muddy the waters long enough to get away with murder? \r\n "

It is a place of enlightenment and skill, a site dedicated to the spirits that guide the Schools of Martial Arts across the land.</p>\r\n<p>Onitama is a two-player abstract strategy game where you take on the role of a Master, guiding your monk followers, in an attempt to defeat your opponent. Armed only with several moves, your wit, and cunning, do you have the skill to be victorious?</p>\r\n<p>With multiple moves to make every game unique, the speed, the grace, and the unique play style of Onitama truly makes this an essential game for any gamer’s collection!</p>\r\n<h3>Multiple Paths to Victory</h3>\r\n<p>There are two methods to achieve victory in Onitama. The first is to capture your opponent’s Master, by landing on it with any of your pieces. The second is to move your Master across the board into your opponent’s Temple Arch space.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

        "faq": "<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Is this compatible with the original Gloomhaven?</strong></p>\r\n<p>All<strong>&nbsp;</strong>new characters introduced in this game are fully compatible with Gloomhaven. Other elements such as new monsters and items cannot be carried over.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How many scenarios are in this game?</strong></p>\r\n<p>There are 25 scenarios, of which the first 5 are tutorials that will slowly get you up to speed on the rules. While it starts out slow, you'll find a noticeable step up in difficulty on scenario 4.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can I play this solo?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Yes. In fact, many board gamers regard Gloomhaven as one of the top solo games out there. But beware that the solo rules require managing two characters. This may put off some solo gamers who feel like it's too much work, while others will enjoy the rich tactical decision-making and discovering the synergy between different classes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Does this game require a Dungeon Master (DM)?</strong></p>\r\n<p>No, but if you'd like to try adding a DM for your group, then take a look at some of the suggestions on <a href=\"https://neuralnetgames.com/does-gloomhaven-have-a-dm/\">this article</a>. The DM could handle admin duties such as moving the monsters and keeping track of status effects, and help accentuate the theme with storytelling.</p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">Should I play this before the original game?</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you're not ready to commit to a $100+ Gloomhaven purchase, go for Jaws of the Lion first. The rulebook \"hand holds\" you through the first five tutorial scenarios, and the scenario book drastically reduces setup and cleanup time by replacing the traditional map tiles. This solution was so well received by fans and reviewers that designer Isaac Childres is developing scenario books for <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/RLlDWHh7hR/gloomhaven\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: 'RLlDWHh7hR', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Gloomhaven</a>&nbsp;and <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/yTs3H7dTLM/frosthaven\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: 'yTs3H7dTLM', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Frosthaven</a>.</p>",
